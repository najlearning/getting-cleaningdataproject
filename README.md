#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

##This is a Course Project in "Getting and Cleaning Data" Module 3 of the Data Science Specialization.

###This repository contains the run_analysis.R script which does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


###The project follows the following tasks:
1. Download the repository zip file of UCI HAR using the RStudio.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Read the file.
4. Assign/name the variables for convention.
5. Perform the required tasks as per the instructions.
6. Produce tidy set of data.
