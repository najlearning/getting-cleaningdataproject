## Introduction
The main goal of the project is to extract the respository raw file from the source and perform some cleaning, merging, and filtering to come up with a refined and tidy data set. The tidy data has three subsets which contain eight files.

### Subsets
The 3 subsets are the following: 'Subject', 'Activity', and 'Features'.
1. The subset 'Subject' comprises the files 'subject_train.txt' and 'subject_test.txt'.
2. The subset 'Activity' comprises the files 'y_train.txt' and 'y_test.txt'. Moreover, their description can be found on 'activity_labels.txt'
3. The subset "Features' comprises of the files 'X_train.txt' and 'X_test.txt'. Descriptions can be found on 'features.txt'.

## Data Source
The data source can be explicitly described as follows:
1. 'features.txt': Commonly known as (variables). This lists all the features in the data.
2. 'activity_labels.txt': This pertains to the class labels with their activity name.
3. 'X_train.txt': This is the Training set.
4. 'y_train.txt': This is the Training labels.
5. 'X_test.txt': This is the Test set.
6. 'y_test.txt': This is the set of Test labels.
7. 'subject_train.txt' and 'subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.
